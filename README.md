# 🌤️ Weather Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based weather prediction model that forecasts weather conditions (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, or rain chances) using historical meteorological data. It can be used for real-time predictions or integrated into larger systems like chatbots, dashboards, or mobile apps.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts weather attributes like:
  - Temperature (°C/°F)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Rainfall (mm or binary: rain/no rain)
  - Wind Speed (km/h)
- Supports training and testing with custom datasets
- Model explainability with feature importance
- Scalable and easy to integrate

## 🧠 Model Details

- ML Algorithms used: 'Random Forest Regressor'
- Data Preprocessing: Missing value handling, feature scaling, and encoding
- Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
